# Sierpinski-gasket-algorithm
A code written in D which implements the algorithm that draws the Sierpinski gasket on the screen.
Download this source code along with the arsd library which can be found here: https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd
Then just compile it using the DMD compiler and the command "dmd sierpinskigasket -m64 -i -J. -O".
Watch the magic happen on the screen.
